# scan_agent

## Introduction
- This is a QRCode Scanner that will submit scanning result to web-hooks of your choice.
- You can pre-define many different scan-actions so that scan results will be submitted to different web-hooks.

## Requirements
- The app using WebRTC protocol to invoke camera/webcam so the app must be run with https support
- Due to technical limit, it could not be run on iPhone or iPad.
- This an WPA app that could run on a Chrome browser on Windows or Android Phone

## Usage
- This app supports a pre-defined list of scanning actions, so you can quickly switch between actions.
- With the pre-defined actions, you can use the app for warehouse management, for events with multiple activities like entrance checkin, lunch checkin, exit-checkin..., or you can design games with many activity checking.  

### Step 1: Prepare
- First you need to prepare a **web-hook url**.
- The url must be https supported.
  Example: "https://192.168.x.y/path/?key=%scanValue%&activityName=checkin&key1=val1&key2=val2"
- The url is anything of your choice, the scanAgent will do replace **%scanValue%** with the ScanContent.
- The system behind the web-hook will receive the ScanContent as you want.
